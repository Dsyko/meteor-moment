# Moment for Meteor

[Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/), a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates, packaged for Meteor.

Please note, this version is hosted on [atmosphere](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/) as "moment-alternative" simply because the orignal "moment" meteorite package has not been updated for some time.

Installation
=============

`mrt add moment-alternative`

Usage
==============
Just like the [moment docs](http://momentjs.com/docs/) tell you:

`var oneMonentPlease = moment()`
